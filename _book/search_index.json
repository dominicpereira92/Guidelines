The first and the most important thing is to ensure the default desktop resolution is set to 1280 x 720.    2. All applications in should in all cases run in full screen so that the viewerâ€™s attention is centered only on the area which is being explained.    3. Aspect Ratio should always be at 1280 x 720p. The half HD format is the standard we use to ensure universal usage and visibility.   4. Font Size should be 16 px, such that it is seen on any hand held device.   5. Codec    For Windows: Lagarith Lossless Video Codec \n\n    For Mac: Animation Codec \n\n   6. Frame Rate : Anywhere between 25 fps or 30 fps, but should be constant throughout.   7.

Practice your narration before you record your screencast.     Find a Quiet Spot in your House     Avoid noise as much as possible. If noise overlaps your speech, post production audio cleaning tends to degrade audio quality.   Choose the Right Mic      Different mics have different recording characteristics.
