The first and the most important thing is to ensure the default desktop resolution is set to 1280 x 720.    2. All applications in should in all cases run in full screen so that the viewer’s attention is centered only on the area which is being explained.    3. Aspect Ratio should always be at 1280 x 720p. The half HD format is the standard we use to ensure universal usage and visibility.   4. Font Size should be 16 px, such that it is seen on any hand held device.   5. Codec    For Windows: Lagarith Lossless Video Codec \n\n    For Mac: Animation Codec \n\n   6. Frame Rate : Anywhere between 25 fps or 30 fps, but should be constant throughout.   7.
